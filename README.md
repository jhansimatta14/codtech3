Objective:Verilog module defines a circuit with various basic logic gates and outputs the results of these gates based on two inputs (i1 and i2). 

**key activites**:

Inputs and Outputs:

input i1, i2; : Defines two input signals.
output o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7; : Defines seven output signals.

Logic Gates:

and g1(o1, i1, i2); : Performs an AND operation. The result (o1) is i1 AND i2.

or g2(o2, i1, i2); : Performs an OR operation. The result (o2) is i1 OR i2.

nand g3(o3, i1, i2); : Performs a NAND operation. The result (o3) is the negation of i1 AND i2.

nor g4(o4, i1, i2); : Performs a NOR operation. The result (o4) is the negation of i1 OR i2.

xor g5(o5, i1, i2); : Performs an XOR operation. The result (o5) is i1 XOR i2.

xnor g6(o6, i1, i2); : Performs an XNOR operation. The result (o6) is the negation of i1 XOR i2.

not g7(o7, i1); : Performs a NOT operation. The result (o7) is the negation of i1.

**Technologies Used**
verilog:The primary programming language for vlsi

ISE Simulator:used for simulation and to obtainthe waveform

xillinx Synthesis tool: to run the code.
